      question: "Are your tutors university students or peer mentors?",
      answer: "Absolutely not. We do not hire casual university student peers. Every single instructor across our network is a fully qualified, background-checked school teacher or career educational specialist with a proven track record of board-specific syllabus delivery.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the custom tutor matching workflow take?",
      answer: "Once you fill out our 6-field evaluation request, an academic board coordinator reads your target milestone criteria and maps your profile. We hand-select and match your student with their perfect educator within 4 to 12 hours.",
    },
    {
      question: "What exactly is included in the post-lesson micro-analytics logs?",
      answer: "Transparency is our primary standard. Within 15 minutes of every single lesson concluding, a comprehensive progress breakdown is pushed to your dashboard. This includes focus metrics, curriculum synchronization targets, and clear actionable homework parameters.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a long-term contract lock-in or subscription requirement?",
      answer: "No. We operate a completely transparent pay-as-you-learn flat hourly pricing framework. You are never locked into monthly minimums, and you can switch subjects, reschedule sessions, or pause your account at any time without admin penalties.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle background security checks and vetting?",
      answer: "Student safety is completely absolute. Every educator on our platform must pass an enhanced criminal record screening (Enhanced DBS in the UK / secure regional identity verification in the US) alongside a rigorous live multi-tier pedagogical presentation audit.",
